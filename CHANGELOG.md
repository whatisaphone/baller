# Changelog

## v0.6.1 – 2025-08-01

- Add better reporting for music errors

## v0.6.0 – 2025-07-31

This release is a major overhaul.

- Baller now has a proper language with a proper parser
  - Improved error reporting, usually with a line/column pointing to the error
  - Source files are now ASCII instead of windows-1252. Within strings, you can use `\x00`-style escapes to represent characters from windows-1252.
  - CRLF is now supported smoothly. You're welcome, Windows users!
- It's now significantly faster. If you have enough CPU cores, extract and build both take under 0.25 seconds.
- Added high-level scripts instead of assembly
  - Perfect matching decompiler/compiler round trips for all supported games
  - Simple type inference for the decompiler
- Many opcodes have changed to more sensible and consistent names
- The compilation target is now a source directive, instead of being detected from the filename
  - The compiler and assembler now only accept opcodes valid for the current target
- Support music (.he4)
- symbols.ini changes
  - All glob types can have names, not just scripts
  - Extracted files are now named after their symbol
  - The locals and types for a script are now defined compactly all on one line
- Add `baller dump` low-level util for examining block structure
- Add `baller saveload dump` command for examining save files
- Add `baller extract --annotate=yes` flag which writes script addresses alongside the decompilation/disassembly
- Expanded block support
  - OBIM – newly supported
  - OBCD – newly supported
  - TALK – newly supported
  - TLKE – newly supported
  - RMIM
    - Support all compression types used across supported titles
    - Don't bail when z-planes are present
    - Extracted bmp files are now spec-compliant
  - AWIZ
    - Support uncompressed encoding
    - Add a flag `baller build --awiz=original` to precisely match the original RLE encoder. This is slightly less space-efficient, but allows 1:1 byte matching the original games.
    - Don't bail when unrecognized child blocks are seen
  - AKOS
    - Byte-identical encoding, same as for AWIZ
  - DIGI
    - Don't bail when unrecognized child blocks are seen

## v0.3.0 – 2024-07-17

v0.3.0 is a rewrite from scratch. It _should_ support everything the previous version did, except for the script decompiler, which is replaced with a disassembler/assembler combo.

This release is dedicated to a mysterious sponsor who I hope to reveal one day!
